			<h1>Destiny (The Never Ending Beta...)</h1>
			<h2>Why Does Bungie Punish Us...</h2>
			<h3>Why would you go dark on us for 3 months,
			While fans demand new content... :'( </h3>
	
			<p>Why have I invested 200+ hours into this game...
			Maybe its because I believe that one day I can go into
			a PVP lobby without someone teleporting across the map and 
			shooting me through a wall. I can dream of change. </p>
			<p> Maybe one day we'll have content that lasts more than one month
			and if we're lucky, we'll have rewarding rewards. I know that's a 
			stretch, but I can dream of change. </p>
